## Summary
This paper assesses the energy efficiency of orange farming in Iran's Mazandaran province, revealing a significant energy imbalance with higher inputs (48,900.5 MJ/ha) than outputs (32,938 MJ/ha). Key energy consumers are chemical fertilizers and chemicals, contributing to a low energy productivity and a negative net energy value. The study underscores the need for orange producers to optimize non-renewable energy use to enhance yield and reduce environmental and health risks.
