## Summary
This paper introduces cost-effective sensors for real-time monitoring of air quality and various indoor conditions, alongside six novel physics-based machine learning (ML) models for precise indoor pollutant concentration predictions. These models integrate state-space concepts in physics with Gated Recurrent Units and Decomposition techniques. Tested in five California commercial building offices, the models prove to be less complex, computationally efficient, and more accurate than comparable state-of-the-art methods. Their success is attributed to a lightweight architecture and the ability to accurately interpret nonlinear patterns in contaminated sensor-collected indoor air quality data.
