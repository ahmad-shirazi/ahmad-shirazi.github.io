## Summary
This paper investigates a kombucha beverage production process in Tehran, Iran, using a novel device. Analyzing 23 batches over a year, it found energy inputs and outputs of 2.77 MJ/L and 8.69 MJ/L, respectively, with significant energy consumption by sugar and the beverage itself. The study indicates a high energy efficiency ratio and financial viability, suggesting that larger production scales could reduce costs due to shared fixed expenses.
