## Summary
This paper analyzes the energy balance in tangerine production in Mazandaran province, Iran, focusing on energy consumption and yield. The study, based on face-to-face interviews, finds that chemical fertilizers and chemicals consume the most energy. With an average yield of 26,862.5 kg/ha and energy consumption of 62,260.9 MJ/ha, the energy productivity is calculated at 0.43 kg/MJ, and the net energy value is −8201.4 MJ/ha. The energy output-to-input ratio stands at approximately 0.87. Applying the Cobb–Douglas production function, the study suggests that tangerine producers need to optimize their use of indirect and non-renewable energy to enhance yield and minimize environmental and health risks.
