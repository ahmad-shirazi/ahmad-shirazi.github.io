## Summary
DocParseNet is a multi-modal deep learning model designed for efficient annotation of scanned documents by integrating visual features from semantic segmentation with textual data extracted using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Its architecture incorporates a modified UNet for image processing, DistilBERT for textual embedding, and a fusion module that combines these modalities using multi-head attention, enabling precise and context-aware document parsing. With only 2.8 million parameters, DocParseNet achieves a remarkable balance of accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability, making it particularly suited for applications in corporate document analysis and beyond.
