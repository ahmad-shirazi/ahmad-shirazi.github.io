## Summary
This paper presents an analysis of biodiesel production from Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) at Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, using the conventional transesterification method. The study, conducted with a 2000 L biodiesel machine over three replications in spring 2012, reveals an energy output/input ratio of 1.49, with renewable energy constituting 77.31% of total inputs. Economically, the benefit-to-cost ratio of biodiesel production is 2.081, with an average net return of $1.298/L and a productivity of 0.946 kg/$. The findings suggest that replacing transesterification with ultrasonic and microwave methods could yield greater benefits and efficiency in biodiesel production.
