I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, where I began my journey in August 2020. Under the expert guidance of [Prof. Rajiv Ramnath](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~ramnath.6/), my research is deeply rooted in the realms of time series machine learning, image processing, and natural language processing (NLP). I am dedicated to exploring intricate algorithms and data analysis techniques within these domains.

In a professional capacity, I have been enhancing my practical skills as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern at [FlairSoft Company](https://flairsoft.net/) in Columbus, Ohio, since May 2022. My role involves a collaborative effort with a team of developers, focusing on developing advanced SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and loading. I am responsible for implementing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. My work also includes applying NLP and machine learning for document information extraction, conducting thorough data analysis to discover patterns and insights, and contributing to code reviews, testing, and debugging. Additionally, I am involved in developing comprehensive software documentation and user manuals for new features and products.


Research
------
I am broadly interested in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and data mining. Nowadays, I am especially passionate about the developments in large language models (LLMs). Some of my past papers are as follows:

* **Time Series**:
  * [Novel Physics-Based Machine-Learning Models for Indoor Air Quality Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01438). Published in [The 9th SIGKDD International Workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series, 2023](https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2023/).

  * [Predicting Airborne Pollutant Concentrations and Events in a Commercial Building Using Low-Cost Pollutant Sensors and Machine Learning: A Case Study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132322000816). Published in [Building and Environment, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/building-and-environment).


* **Multimodal**:

  <!-- * [DocParseNet: Advanced Semantic Segmentation and OCR Embeddings for Efficient Scanned Document Annotation](). Submitted in CVPR -->

  * [CrashFormer: A Multimodal Architecture to Predict the Risk of Crash](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3615900.3628769). Published in [Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Advances in Urban-AI, 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3615900).
