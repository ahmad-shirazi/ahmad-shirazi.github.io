Since August 2020, I have been pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at The Ohio State University under the expert guidance of [Prof. Rajiv Ramnath](https://cse.osu.edu/people/ramnath.6). My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Time Series Analysis, and Multimodal Systems, with a strong emphasis on bridging vision and language understanding and document processing. My work has been recognized at prestigious conferences such as ICML and SIGKDD.

In May 2022, I joined [Flairsoft](https://flairsoft.net/)  as a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, where Iâ€™ve developed advanced solutions, including risk analysis models, speech-to-text systems, and document annotation tools. Combining academic research with practical applications, I am committed to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world challenges and drive innovation.

Research
------
I am broadly interested in the fields of Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Multimodal Systems, and Time Series Analysis. My research explores innovative ways to bridge vision and language understanding, focusing on document processing and predictive modeling. Some of my past papers are as follows:


* **Multimodal**:

  * [DLaVA: Document Language and Vision Assistant for Answer Localization with Enhanced Interpretability and Trustworthiness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00151). Submitted in [CVPR, 2024](https://github.com/ahmad-shirazi/AnnotMLLM).
 
  * [DocParseNet: Advanced Semantic Segmentation and OCR Embeddings for Efficient Scanned Document Annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17591). Published in [ICML, 2024](https://github.com/ahmad-shirazi/DocParseNet)

  * [CrashFormer: A Multimodal Architecture to Predict the Risk of Crash](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3615900.3628769). Published in [Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Advances in Urban-AI, 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3615900).


* **Time Series**:

  * [DSSRNN: Decomposition-Enhanced State-Space Recurrent Neural Network for Time-Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00994). Submitted in [KDD 2025](https://github.com/ahmad-shirazi/DSSRNN).
